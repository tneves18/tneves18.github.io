                     Few sweet snacks embody summer quite like a peach. 
                     Feeling the soft fuzz against your upper lip and sweet 
                     juice dripping from the corners of your mouth onto your 
                     hands are what warm backyard nights are made of.

                        Peaches play important roles in healthy aging. 
                        One day I would have all the books in the world, 
                        shelves and shelves of them. I would live my life 
                        in a tower of books. I would read all day long and 
                        eat peaches to live happily ever after.

                 <h2>It tastes like Summer.</h2>
                 <h3>Better than an apple.</h3>
                 <p>
                        Actually an apple is an excellent thing until you 
                        have tried a peach. But the ripest peach is highest 
                        \on the tree. And sunrise paints the sky with pinks 
                        and the sunset with peaches. But you don't come in 
                        here on sunday with a big banana and expect everything 
                        to be peaches. To find happiness, it is not quite difficult 
                        thing. It is just enough to distinguish the blue of the sky 
                        from the pink of peach flowers which are opening out.
